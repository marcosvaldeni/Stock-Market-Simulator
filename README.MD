# :construction_worker: Installation

**You need to install at least [Java 8](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html) and [MySQL 5.7](https://www.mysql.com/downloads/), I would recommend [Xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) in order to run MySQL with phpMyAdmin, then to clone the project via HTTPS, run this command:**

```git clone https://github.com/marcosvaldeni/Stock-Market-Simulator```

SSH URLs provide access to a Git repository via SSH, a secure protocol. If you have a SSH key registered in your Github account, clone the project using this command:

```git clone git@github.com:marcosvaldeni/Stock-Market-Simulator.git```

# :runner: Getting Started

**Importing database**

To prepare the database, run the content of the file [StockMarketSimulator.sql](https://github.com/marcosvaldeni/Stock-Market-Simulator/blob/master/StockMarketSimulator.sql) on the phpMyAdmin `console`.

**Setup the credetials**

Once the program is running, it will request Database preferences: `user`, `password`, `port` and `host`.
